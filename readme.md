# sync thing

Two little scripts that sync bookmarks and articles to Logseq, where it will be published on [notes.sanderdorigo.nl](https://notes.sanderdorigo.nl).

## Basic instructions

- First clone the repository, and copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- You'll need [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install the dependencies using `composer install`
- Filling in the details in the `.env` file is enough. You only need the Wallabag + Nextcloud details.
  - Both should be reachable from the web, be sure to use `https://`

If you have questions, let me know.
